# Monospaced Unity Console
Why not?

---  

Unity 2021.2+ has built-in support for Monospaced Font in the console.  
Simply enable "Use Monospace Font" in the dropdown at the top right of the Console Window.

As of version 1.0.2 this package will remove itself when installed in Unity version at or above 2021.2.
